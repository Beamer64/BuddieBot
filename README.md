## Setting Up

You have to create a `config.yaml` file in order to run the bot (you can use the example file provided as a base). Your file should look something like this:

```
# Tokens/API Keys
keys:
  botToken: ""
  webHookToken: ""
  botPublicKey: ""
  tenorAPIkey: ""
  insultAPI: "https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=json"

# IDs relating to Discord or Bot
discordIDs:
  webHookID: ""
  errorLogChannelID: ""

# Custom Settings
settings:
  botPrefix: ""
  botAdminRole: ""

# VM Server Info
vm:
  sshKeyBody: ""
  machineIP: ""
  type: "service_account"
  project_id: ""
  private_key_id: ""
  private_key: ""
  client_email: ""
  client_id: ""
  auth_uri: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
  token_uri: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
  client_x509_cert_url: ""
  zone: ""
```

*The 'vm' section is for the GCP VM hosting of the Minecraft server. This can be omitted if unused.*

Visit the Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app and use the client token you are given for the `token` option. To get keys for supported APIs,
visit:

* [Tenor API](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation)
* [Google APIs](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/)
* [Insult API](https://evilinsult.com/api/)

After your `config.yaml` file is built, you have to enable `Privileged Intents` on your Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You can find these intents under
the "Bot" section, and there are two ticks you have to switch on. For more information on Gateway Intents, check out [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html) link.

Once done, feel free to launch BuddieBot using the command `go run cmd/discord-bot/main.go`.
