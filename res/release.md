# release Notes 2/11/2022

<h2> Here is a more detailed look at the most recent release notes.</h2>
These notes may include any changes from bot behavior to commands to comment and future changes.


<h3> Comments: </h3>
In regards to some names of commands and groups like "img-set", "get" or any individual command, I'm not set on keeping these names and will most likely change them in the future. If anyone has any suggestion for a better naming group whether it be for typing convince or a better descriptor for the command or group then please let me know, and we can discuss the change.

&nbsp;

For some of these newer commands, I will be testing them more in the future but haven't fully tested them at this moment. Please feel free to inform me of any that aren't working. If you feel one
isn't working, make sure to retry the command but not in quick succession. If after multiple attempts, the command will not work then just let me know with what info you have.

&nbsp;

Thanks big bunches luv u.
