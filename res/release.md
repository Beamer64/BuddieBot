# release Notes 7/10/2022

<h2> Here is a more detailed look at the most recent release notes.</h2>
These notes may include any changes from bot behavior to commands to comment and future changes.


<h3> Comments: </h3>
In regards to some names of commands and groups like "img-set", "get" or any individual command, I'm not set on keeping these names and will most likely change them in the future. If anyone has any suggestion for a better naming group whether it be for typing convince or a better descriptor for the command or group then please let me know, and we can discuss the change.

&nbsp;

For some of these newer commands, I will be testing them more in the future but haven't fully tested them at this moment. Please feel free to inform me of any that aren't working. If you feel one
isn't working, make sure to retry the command but not in quick succession. If after multiple attempts, the command will not work then just let me know with what info you have.

&nbsp;

Thanks big bunches luv u.

The command **/pick poll** will allow you to suggest a request item {request} and then a minimum of 2 poll items {poll_item}. The items are represented by emoji reactions which are used to vote on the different items. NOTE some emojis are pulled from a list and aren't compatible with discord. I'm aware this will case the command to break. I'm logging with emojis are not compaitble and will remove them from the list. In this event, just copy the command and run it again, thx.

The command **/pick album** will allow BB to suggest a music album to listen to based off of typed tags. When using the command, type in a maximun of 6 tags for the music you like and BB will produce up to 5 albums for you to try. A list of acceptable tags can be found at https://github.com/Beamer64/DiscordBot/blob/master/res/album_tags.txt (This is a temperary location until we can find a more permanent and effective solution)

There is a new prefix command in the bot relating to SpongeBob. It's an old inside joke from the developer and the only hint is that I've used it before in a past project.
