# release Notes 02/25/25

<h2> Here is a more detailed look at the most recent release notes.</h2>
These notes may include any changes from bot behavior to commands to comment and future changes.


<h3> Comments: </h3>
In regards to some names of commands and groups like "img-set", "get" or any individual command, I'm not set on keeping these names and will most likely change them in the future. If anyone has any suggestion for a better naming group whether it be for typing convince or a better descriptor for the command or group then please let me know, and we can discuss the change.

&nbsp;

For some of these newer commands, I will be testing them more in the future but haven't fully tested them at this moment. Please feel free to inform me of any that aren't working.
If you feel one
isn't working, make sure to retry the command but not in quick succession. If after multiple attempts, the command will not work then just let me know with what info you have.

Thanks big bunches luv u.

<h3> New Prefix Commands: </h3>

**These changes are limited to any command that needs the designated prefix (Ex '$') to run.**

* $cistercian

&nbsp;

<h3> Change Details </h3>

**These are a more detailed look at the new changes to BuddieBot.**

These commands have been added under the new /txt command group. These commands are used to change the text of a message to a different font or style. The command will return
the altered text. Give them a try.

* leet
* emoji
* clap
* bubble text
* cursive
* flipped
* creepify (cursed)

---

This command is not a meme and is a really fun and cool game that you should play.

* /play just-lost

---

This new command will generate a fake person for you to use in any situation. The command will return a generated person with multiple properties.

* /get fake-person

---

This new command will generate a random cat image for you. No one asked for this and you're welcome.

* /animals katz

---

There is a new prefix command in the bot for something really cool. It relates to cistercian numbers which basically use a 4x4 grid to represent any number from 0 to 9999. The
command will return the number in cistercian form using a generated line image....in Go. I drew the lines...with Go. Related info can be found in the results for the command.

* $cistercian

&nbsp;

<h3> Enhancements: </h3>

**These are any changes related to existing items.**

* When searching for a YouTube audio to play, a "Sorry! We couldn't find this file" message will be sent if the audio is not found. This is to help with any confusion as to why
  the audio is not playing. This could also result from a timeout. Either way, you aren't getting the audio, wah wah.

* The BuddieBot repo was renamed from "DiscordBot" to "BuddieBot" to better reflect my unique and creative naming skills.

&nbsp;

<h3> Bug Fixes: </h3>

**Any bug fixes that have been suggested are posted here.**

* Fixed a bug that wouldn't let you play audio. I honestly can't remember this, so I hope its actually fixed.
