## About

BuddieBot is an open source Discord bot written in Golang that I initially created to develop and maintain new Golang technologies and practices. What originally started as a fun idea and grown into a full personal pet project. I love working on BuddieBot to improve it with new features and utilities all the time. I enjoy using BuddieBot in my personal servers and plan to continue growing this bot for the foreseeable future!

If you liked this repository, feel free to leave a star ‚≠ê to help promote BuddieBot!

## Setting Up

You have to create a `config.yaml` file in order to run the bot (you can use the example file provided as a base). Your file should look something like this:

```
# Tokens/API Keys
keys:
  prodBotToken:   ""
  testBotToken:   ""
  webHookToken:   ""
  botPublicKey:   ""
  dagpiAPIkey:    ""
  tenorAPIkey:    ""
  steamAPI:       "http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v0002/?key=STEAMKEY&format=json"
  affirmationAPI: "https://www.affirmations.dev/"
  kanyeAPI:       "https://api.kanye.rest/"
  adviceAPI:      "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice"
  doggoAPI:       "https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/images/search"
  albumPickerAPI: "http://recommended-album-api-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/prediction/"
  wyrAPI:         "https://would-you-rather-api.abaanshanid.repl.co/"

# IDs relating to Discord or Bot
discordIDs:
  currentBotAppID:     "" # Don't set. This gets set later.
  prodBotAppID:        ""
  testBotAppID:        ""
  masterGuildID:       ""
  testGuildID:         ""
  webHookID:           ""
  errorLogChannelID:   ""
  eventNotifChannelID: ""

# Custom Settings
settings:
  botPrefix:     ""
  botAdminRole:  ""
  # Used for email sending
  email:         ""
  emailPassword: ""

database:
  tableName: ""
  region:    ""
  accessKey: ""
  secretKey: ""
```

*Sections like "database" and various "IDs" are used for specfic functions or features. This can be omitted if unused. That part of the bot just wont work until supplied.*

Visit the Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) to create an app and use the client token you are given for the `token` option. To get keys for supported APIs,
visit:

* [Tenor API](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation)
* [Dagpi API](https://dagpi.xyz)

After your `config.yaml` file is built, you have to enable `Privileged Intents` on your Discord [developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You can find these intents under
the "Bot" section, and there are two ticks you have to switch on. For more information on Gateway Intents, check out [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html) link.

Once done, feel free to launch BuddieBot using the command `go run cmd/discord-bot/main.go`.
